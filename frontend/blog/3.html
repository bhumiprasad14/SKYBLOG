    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Explore utility-first CSS and how Tailwind CSS revolutionizes styling in modern web applications. Tailwind CSS provides a different approach to styling compared to traditional CSS frameworks, focusing on utility classes that you can compose to build any design.</p>

    <h2>Utility-First Philosophy</h2>
    <p>The utility-first approach means you build designs by composing small, single-purpose utility classes. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use pre-defined utility classes to style your components directly in HTML.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>Tailwind makes responsive design simple and intuitive. Use breakpoint prefixes to apply styles at different screen sizes, building mobile-first designs with ease and flexibility.</p>

    <h2>Component Composition</h2>
    <p>Learn how to build reusable component patterns using Tailwind utilities. Extract common patterns and create maintainable component structures that scale with your project.</p>

    <h2>Theming and Customization</h2>
    <p>Customize Tailwind to match your brand with a powerful configuration system. Define custom colors, fonts, spacing, and more to create a unique design system for your project.</p>

    <h2>Optimization</h2>
    <p>Optimize your Tailwind CSS builds for production. Learn how to purge unused styles, minify your CSS, and deliver lean stylesheets that load quickly.</p>
