    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Learn how to set up a modern React application with TypeScript for type-safe development. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to get started with React and TypeScript, from project setup to building your first components with full type safety.</p>

    <h2>Project Setup</h2>
    <p>Setting up a React project with TypeScript is easier than ever with modern tooling. You can use Create React App, Vite, or other scaffolding tools to get started. Each tool provides excellent TypeScript support out of the box.</p>

    <h2>Component Patterns</h2>
    <p>React components with TypeScript follow familiar patterns but with added type safety. You'll define interfaces for props, manage state with proper typing, and leverage TypeScript's powerful type system to catch errors at compile time.</p>

    <h2>Type Definitions</h2>
    <p>TypeScript type definitions make your code more maintainable and self-documenting. By properly typing your components, hooks, and state, you create a better development experience for yourself and your team.</p>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Follow established best practices for React and TypeScript development to build scalable applications. Use proper typing patterns, leverage the type system effectively, and write clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time.</p>
