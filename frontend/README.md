# TechBlog — Local copy

This is a lightweight static replica of the Figma site you provided.

Quick start:

```powershell
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

To deploy to GitHub Pages:
- Create a new repository, push these files to `main`.
- In repo settings, enable Pages from `main` root.

If you want, I can commit and push to a GitHub repo and deploy for you (I'll need repo access).
